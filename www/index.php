							 <p style="text-align:justify;color:white;margin:20px;font-size:20px;font-weight:bolder;"> The basic motivation came from the realization of the need of PROPER GUIDANCE of students regarding their project. It will provide them a platform to interact with the previous work or what kind of projects could be made. Secondly students can also continue uncomplete projects if they can make enhancement in that project and then they can publish it with their name which is a good approach. One can get the idea with the previous work too and can add new features or functionalities according to the need in it. </p>
